# Hello there!

You've run into my GitHub it appears. Welcome.
**I'm O. Kaya. McGill Alum, AAA/Indie GameDev and maker of random software.**
- ðŸ“« Contact: ogulcan.kaya@mail.mcgill.ca
- âž• My portfolio: https://portfolio.okaya.dev
- ðŸ”­ Current work: Contract NDA Projects, Unrevealed indie games.

I've been doing Tech Design roles lately, but have experience in full programmer roles, a CS diploma, and passion for problem solving in general. If you're interested in collaborating, feel free to reach out!

**Please note: a lot of my best work is software on projects that are NDA/commercial/coursework or otherwise closed source, this is a mere sample.**

Here, you will find some of the projects I've worked on over the years, notably:
- Assignments: Old assignments from my time at McGill University.
- Various games: A lot of my projects are commercial and/or involve closed source code from other developers, but I make public what I can.
- A few systems: OKFish, a crowd AI system, or OKTank and OKZeppelin, Tank and Zeppelin controllers respectively.
- A bunch of random projects: DesktopCat, a cute cat that sits on your desktop and motivates you, and hibot, a discord bot that exists to annoy.
