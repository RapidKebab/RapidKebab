### Hello there!

You've run into my GitHub it appears. Welcome. I'm Ogulcan Kaya. A CS student at McGill University and hobbyist game developer, currently in my second year.

My primary interests are AI and Game Development as of now but I'm eternally curious and interested in doing any sort of work that widens my horizons, relates to my skillset, and allows me to be a better programmer and developer in general. So feel free to contact me for projects and work from any part of the software spectrum.

Here, you will find some of the projects I've worked on over the years. As of now, I don't think it's a good idea to be publishing my course exercises or codebases for commercial projects.
