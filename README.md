# Hello there!

You've run into my GitHub it appears. Welcome.
#### I'm Ogulcan Kaya. A CS student at McGill University, hobbyist game developer and maker of random software, Graduating 2023.
- ðŸ“« Contact: ogulcan.kaya@mail.mcgill.ca
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him or They/Them
- âž• More of my stuff: oksoft.itch.io/

My primary interests are Physics, AI, and Game Development as of now but I'm eternally curious and interested in doing any sort of work that widens my horizons, relates to my skillset, and allows me to be a better programmer and developer in general. So feel free to contact me for projects and work from any part of the software spectrum.

Here, you will find some of the projects I've worked on over the years, notably:
- Various games: A lot of my projects are commercial and/or involve closed source code from other developers, but I make public what I can.
- A few systems: OKFish, a crowd AI system, or OKTank and OKZeppelin, Tank and Zeppelin controllers respectively.
- A bunch of random projects: DesktopCat, a cute cat that sits on your desktop and motivates you, and hibot, a discord bot that exists to annoy.
